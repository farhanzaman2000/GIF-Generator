# GIF-Generator
A GIF generator that produces a GIF with the same FPS as the video input file (in mp4. format) built with python. 

# NOTE
You need to install imageio and imageio-ffmpeg in your terminal before being able to use this. 

<!-- install pip3 imageio imageio-ffmpeg -->

# HOW TO USE IT: 
Just change the name of your mp4. file in line 5 and make sure it's in the same folder/directory as the .py file. After that,
click Run and let the machine do the magic!!

# DISCLAIMER:
Note that it might take very long to generate GIFs for large files, so you might want to optimise the .mp4 file by compressing it on https://clideo.com/compress-video.
